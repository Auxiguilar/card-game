# card-game
Some kinda card game.

Todo:
1. ~~Represent a deck and cards.~~
2. ~~Represent a hand.~~
3. ~~Implement hi-lo game or something simple.~~
4. ~~Represent a player (for betting, whatever else, etc.).~~
    - Maybe a base player class that game specific player classes inherit from?
5. Make another simple game.
6. Make main.py the main interface to tie it all together.
    - Hopefully I can let a game crash without nuking the whole program...
    - Basically the main menu! (get it???)
